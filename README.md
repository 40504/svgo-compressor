# SVGO Compressor

A Plugin that compresses SVG assets using SVGO, right when you export them. This Plugin *requires* Sketch 3.8.

## Install

- Download [SVGO Compressor](#)
- Double click to install

## Usage

Selecting menu items or hitting keys is out of fashion, so SVGO Compressor will compress your SVG assets whenever you export them, without you having to do anything.

You'll get a message on your document window showing some stats about the process to let you know the compression worked as expected.

## Editing Settings

If for some reason you're not happy with the default settings we've chosen, you can select **Plugins › SVGO Compressor › About SVGO Compressor** and then click the **Edit SVGO Settings…** button. You default editor will open the `svgo.json` file, where you'll be able to tweak the settings.

For an explanation of what each SVGO Plugin does, please refer to the [SVGO page on GitHub](https://github.com/svg/svgo#what-it-can-do).
